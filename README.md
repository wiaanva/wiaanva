- 👋 Hi, I’m Willem!
- 👀 I’m interested in sharing insightful data stories by building efficacious relationships with any data.  On a personal note I try to design websites, play some guitar, am an Apex Legends champion, ride mountain bikes and are training for open water swimming competitions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much about data and application design as possible.  Shaw Academy's Professional Degree in Computer Science; Microsoft's Azure certification (Data Engineer Associate, Data Analyst Associate); Google Analytics and Kimball's datawarehouse design methodologies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... t-sql query optimisations, data modelling, website design and statistics.
